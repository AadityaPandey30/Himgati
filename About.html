        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>After the formation of Himachal on 15th July, 1948 the network of roads had received top-most priority of the Government. At present the road network is widely spread in Himachal. In 1974 total routes operated by HRTC were 379 which have Grown to 2850 in December 2018 and the fleet strength has grown from 733 to 3130 in December 2018.</p><br>

            <p>Bus remains the sole mode of passenger transportation in the state as railways have a negligible presence in the State. The narrow gauge lines connecting Pathankot with Jogindernagar and Kalka with Shimla are so slow moving that a very small percentage of traffic is carried by them at present; thereby leaving the onus of carrying the passenger traffic on to bus transport.</p><br>
        
        <p>The website aims at improving the Bus and Roadway services by providing real time locationtoits Users while also providing the expected time of arrival. All the news conveyed by the State Government of Himachal regarding roadways is provided on the website. Your feedback to improve us is warmly welcomed.</p>
